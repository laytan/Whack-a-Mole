# Whack-a-Mole
**TL;DR:**
*This is a web based mostly plain javascript game inspired by the famous arcade game mainly seen on fairs called __Whack a Mole__, where the goal is to slam as much moles in the least amount of time as possible. Give it a play!* 


Everybody has probably heard of the popular arcade game as seen on most fairs. This was my inspiration when my class got the instruction
to make a game using the following:
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ Plain Javascript

The time frame was a bit tricky but i got it done in about 2 weeks of on and off development(Other classes included) and i learned alot about Javascript like events, input and using features like changing css in Javascript to actually make a board which is able to change its size.

This was my first time using Javascript in such an interactive way and i thought it was very intriguing,
this made me get into actual game development. 
Please checkout my first unity game i have ever made __[A way with words](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.laytangames.awaywithwords).__ I was very proud of myself for making this! It is online on android and the goal is to make as much words with the given letters, you get points for every word and bonus points for complication in the words. All of it in a time frame of ~30 seconds.
