# Whack-a-Mole
**TL;DR:**
*This is a web based mostly plain javascript game inspired by the famous arcade game mainly seen on fairs called __Whack a Mole__, where the goal is to slam as much moles in the least amount of time as possible. Give it a play!* 


Everybody has probably heard of the popular arcade game as seen on most fairs. This was my inspiration when my class got the instruction
to make a game using the following:
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ Plain Javascript

The time frame was a bit tricky but i got it done in about 2 weeks of on and off development(Other classes included) and i learned alot about Javascript like events, input and using features like changing css in Javascript to actually make a board which is able to change its size.
